*Zhixin Pan,Ziyu Shu,Linh Nguyen,Amberbir Alemayoh*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: SAND：一种自监督自适应NAS驱动框架，用于高效硬件木马检测，无需手动特征工程，通过NAS优化分类器，显著提升检测准确率并展示强泛化能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球化半导体供应链中硬件木马（HT）对嵌入式系统构成重大安全威胁，现有基于机器学习的HT检测技术存在特征选择随意且缺乏自适应性的问题，难以应对多样化HT攻击

Method: 1. 利用自监督学习（SSL）实现自动化特征提取，消除手动特征工程的依赖；2. 集成神经架构搜索（NAS）动态优化下游分类器，仅需微调即可适配新场景

Result: 1. 检测准确率较现有最优方法提升高达18.3%；2. 对规避性木马具有高抵抗力；3. 展现出强大的泛化能力

Conclusion: SAND框架克服了现有HT检测技术的局限性，通过SSL和NAS的结合实现了高效、自适应的检测方案，为硬件安全领域提供了创新解决方案

Abstract: The globalized semiconductor supply chain has made Hardware Trojans (HT) a
significant security threat to embedded systems, necessitating the design of
efficient and adaptable detection mechanisms. Despite promising machine
learning-based HT detection techniques in the literature, they suffer from ad
hoc feature selection and the lack of adaptivity, all of which hinder their
effectiveness across diverse HT attacks. In this paper, we propose SAND, a
selfsupervised and adaptive NAS-driven framework for efficient HT detection.
Specifically, this paper makes three key contributions. (1) We leverage
self-supervised learning (SSL) to enable automated feature extraction,
eliminating the dependency on manually engineered features. (2) SAND integrates
neural architecture search (NAS) to dynamically optimize the downstream
classifier, allowing for seamless adaptation to unseen benchmarks with minimal
fine-tuning. (3) Experimental results show that SAND achieves a significant
improvement in detection accuracy (up to 18.3%) over state-of-the-art methods,
exhibits high resilience against evasive Trojans, and demonstrates strong
generalization.

### [3] [EthVault: A Secure and Resource-Conscious FPGA-Based Ethereum Cold Wallet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23847)
*Joel Poncha Lemayian,Ghyslain Gagnon,Kaiwen Zhang,Pascal Giard*

Main category: cs.CR

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的软件钱包易受恶意软件和侧信道攻击，私钥安全性不足。需要一种硬件方案实现安全密钥生成和交易授权。

Method: 1) 设计抗侧信道和时序攻击的ECC架构；2) 实现子密钥派生功能的硬件架构；3) 最小化资源占用以支持便携设备。

Result: FPGA验证表明：ECC在输入变化时执行行为一致；在Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ FPGA上仅消耗LUT(27%)、寄存器(7%)和RAM块(6%)。

Conclusion: EthVault通过硬件级解决方案有效提升钱包安全性，资源优化使便携设备成为可能。

Abstract: Cryptocurrency blockchain networks safeguard digital assets using
cryptographic keys, with wallets playing a critical role in generating,
storing, and managing these keys. Wallets, typically categorized as hot and
cold, offer varying degrees of security and convenience. However, they are
generally software-based applications running on microcontrollers.
Consequently, they are vulnerable to malware and side-channel attacks, allowing
perpetrators to extract private keys by targeting critical algorithms, such as
ECC, which processes private keys to generate public keys and authorize
transactions. To address these issues, this work presents EthVault, the first
hardware architecture for an Ethereum hierarchically deterministic cold wallet,
featuring hardware implementations of key algorithms for secure key generation.
Also, an ECC architecture resilient to side-channel and timing attacks is
proposed. Moreover, an architecture of the child key derivation function, a
fundamental component of cryptocurrency wallets, is proposed. The design
minimizes resource usage, meeting market demand for small, portable
cryptocurrency wallets. FPGA implementation results validate the feasibility of
the proposed approach. The ECC architecture exhibits uniform execution behavior
across varying inputs, while the complete design utilizes only 27%, 7%, and 6%
of LUTs, registers, and RAM blocks, respectively, on a Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+
FPGA.

### [4] [PRO: Enabling Precise and Robust Text Watermark for Open-Source LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23891)
*Jiaqi Xue,Yifei Zhao,Mansour Al Ghanim,Shangqian Gao,Ruimin Sun,Qian Lou,Mengxin Zheng*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为PRO的精确鲁棒文本水印方法，用于开源大语言模型（LLMs），通过联合训练水印策略模型和水印正则化来提升水印检测能力及抗下游修改的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前为开源LLMs添加水印的挑战在于：1）无法控制解码过程；2）现有蒸馏方法存在模式不匹配导致检测性差，且无法抵抗微调或模型合并等操作。

Method: 方法包括：1）联合训练水印策略模型与LLM，使水印模式易于学习且符合检测标准；2）引入正则化项模拟下游扰动，惩罚检测能力退化。

Result: 在LLaMA-3.2、LLaMA-3、Phi-2等模型上的实验表明，PRO显著提升了水印检测能力及对模型修改的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PRO为开源LLMs提供了有效的产权保护手段，解决了水印嵌入困难、检测率低、抗扰动差等关键问题。

Abstract: Text watermarking for large language models (LLMs) enables model owners to
verify text origin and protect intellectual property. While watermarking
methods for closed-source LLMs are relatively mature, extending them to
open-source models remains challenging, as developers cannot control the
decoding process. Consequently, owners of open-source LLMs lack practical means
to verify whether text was generated by their models. A core difficulty lies in
embedding watermarks directly into model weights without hurting detectability.
A promising idea is to distill watermarks from a closed-source model into an
open one, but this suffers from (i) poor detectability due to mismatch between
learned and predefined patterns, and (ii) fragility to downstream modifications
such as fine-tuning or model merging. To overcome these limitations, we propose
PRO, a Precise and Robust text watermarking method for open-source LLMs. PRO
jointly trains a watermark policy model with the LLM, producing patterns that
are easier for the model to learn and more consistent with detection criteria.
A regularization term further simulates downstream perturbations and penalizes
degradation in watermark detectability, ensuring robustness under model edits.
Experiments on open-source LLMs (e.g., LLaMA-3.2, LLaMA-3, Phi-2) show that PRO
substantially improves both watermark detectability and resilience to model
modifications.

### [5] [Scalable GPU-Based Integrity Verification for Large Machine Learning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23938)
*Marcin Spoczynski,Marcela S. Melara*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 该论文提出一个安全框架，通过在CPU和GPU平台上标准化完整性保护，显著减少验证开销。框架将完整性验证直接集成到GPU上的大型机器学习模型执行中，解决了传统CPU验证与主要在GPU上运行的ML工作负载不匹配的问题，从而提升性能并确保架构一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型机器学习工作负载主要在GPU上运行，而传统的安全验证通常在CPU上执行，这种不匹配导致验证成为性能瓶颈。随着模型规模增大（超过100GB），CPU验证效率低下，无法跟上模型执行速度。因此，需要一种在GPU内部集成高效验证的机制，同时兼顾跨硬件平台的通用性。

Method: 该框架在GPU加速器上原生执行完整性验证，利用GPU专用计算单元（如Intel XMX、NVIDIA Tensor Cores）进行加密操作。这种方法利用GPU的高内存带宽和并行处理能力，确保验证与模型执行同步。此外，该方案预留了与可信执行环境（TEE）的安全通道接口，实现硬件无关性。

Result: 该方法成功消除了CPU验证的性能瓶颈，使验证操作能与超大规模模型（>100GB）的执行同步进行，并提供跨GPU厂商和硬件配置的一致性验证机制。

Conclusion: 该框架为分布式机器学习提供了一种高效、硬件无关的完整性保护方案，统一了GPU与CPU的安全验证路径，为企业部署可扩展的安全ML基础设施奠定了基础。

Abstract: We present a security framework that strengthens distributed machine learning
by standardizing integrity protections across CPU and GPU platforms and
significantly reducing verification overheads. Our approach co-locates
integrity verification directly with large ML model execution on GPU
accelerators, resolving the fundamental mismatch between how large ML workloads
typically run (primarily on GPUs) and how security verifications traditionally
operate (on separate CPU-based processes), delivering both immediate
performance benefits and long-term architectural consistency. By performing
cryptographic operations natively on GPUs using dedicated compute units (e.g.,
Intel Arc's XMX units, NVIDIA's Tensor Cores), our solution eliminates the
potential architectural bottlenecks that could plague traditional CPU-based
verification systems when dealing with large models. This approach leverages
the same GPU-based high-memory bandwidth and parallel processing primitives
that power ML workloads ensuring integrity checks keep pace with model
execution even for massive models exceeding 100GB. This framework establishes a
common integrity verification mechanism that works consistently across
different GPU vendors and hardware configurations. By anticipating future
capabilities for creating secure channels between trusted execution
environments and GPU accelerators, we provide a hardware-agnostic foundation
that enterprise teams can deploy regardless of their underlying CPU and GPU
infrastructures.

### [6] [Traceable Signatures from Lattices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24101)
*Nam Tran,Khoa Nguyen,Dongxi Liu,Josef Pieprzyk,Willy Susilo*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 首次基于格假设构造了可在量子随机预言机模型（QROM）下证明安全的可追踪签名方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可追踪签名方案均基于数论/配对假设，无法抵抗量子计算机攻击，因此需要后量子安全的替代方案。

Method: 提出基于格难题（lattice-based assumptions）的新型可追踪签名构造，其安全性证明依赖量子随机预言机模型（QROM）。

Result: 成功实现首个后量子安全的可追踪签名方案，填补了该密码学原语在后量子时代的安全空白。

Conclusion: 该工作将可追踪签名概念拓展至后量子密码学领域，验证了格密码技术在该类复杂签名系统中的可行性。

Abstract: Traceable signatures (Kiayas et al., EUROCRYPT 2004) is an anonymous digital
signature system that extends the tracing power of the opening authority in
group signatures. There are many known constructions of traceable signatures,
but all are based on number-theoretic/pairing assumptions. For such reason,
they may not be secure in the presence of quantum computers. This work revisits
the notion of traceable signatures and presents a lattice-based construction
provably secure in the quantum random oracle model (QROM).

Abstract: Mini-programs, an emerging mobile application paradigm within super-apps,
offer a seamless and installation-free experience. However, the adoption of the
web-view component has disrupted their isolation mechanisms, exposing new
attack surfaces and vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce a novel
vulnerability called Cross Mini-program Cookie Sharing (CMCS), which arises
from the shared web-view environment across mini-programs. This vulnerability
allows unauthorized data exchange across mini-programs by enabling one
mini-program to access cookies set by another within the same web-view context,
violating isolation principles. As a preliminary step, we analyzed the web-view
mechanisms of four major platforms, including WeChat, AliPay, TikTok, and
Baidu, and found that all of them are affected by CMCS vulnerabilities.
Furthermore, we demonstrate the collusion attack enabled by CMCS, where
privileged mini-programs exfiltrate sensitive user data via cookies accessible
to unprivileged mini-programs. To measure the impact of collusion attacks
enabled by CMCS vulnerabilities in the wild, we developed MiCoScan, a static
analysis tool that detects mini-programs affected by CMCS vulnerabilities.
MiCoScan employs web-view context modeling to identify clusters of
mini-programs sharing the same web-view domain and cross-webview data flow
analysis to detect sensitive data transmissions to/from web-views. Using
MiCoScan, we conducted a large-scale analysis of 351,483 mini-programs,
identifying 45,448 clusters sharing web-view domains, 7,965 instances of
privileged data transmission, and 9,877 mini-programs vulnerable to collusion
attacks. Our findings highlight the widespread prevalence and significant
security risks posed by CMCS vulnerabilities, underscoring the urgent need for
improved isolation mechanisms in mini-program ecosystems.

Conclusion: 阵列指纹能有效提升被动活体检测的鲁棒性和准确率，ARRAYID方案具有实用价值。

Abstract: Though playing an essential role in smart home systems, smart speakers are
vulnerable to voice spoofing attacks. Passive liveness detection, which
utilizes only the collected audio rather than the deployed sensors to
distinguish between live-human and replayed voices, has drawn increasing
attention. However, it faces the challenge of performance degradation under the
different environmental factors as well as the strict requirement of the fixed
user gestures.
  In this study, we propose a novel liveness feature, array fingerprint, which
utilizes the microphone array inherently adopted by the smart speaker to
determine the identity of collected audios. Our theoretical analysis
demonstrates that by leveraging the circular layout of microphones, compared
with existing schemes, array fingerprint achieves a more robust performance
under the environmental change and user's movement. Then, to leverage such a
fingerprint, we propose ARRAYID, a lightweight passive detection scheme, and
elaborate a series of features working together with array fingerprint. Our
evaluation on the dataset containing 32,780 audio samples and 14 spoofing
devices shows that ARRAYID achieves an accuracy of 99.84%, which is superior to
existing passive liveness detection schemes.

TL;DR: Summary generation failed

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs) deployed on memristive crossbar arrays
provide energy-efficient solutions for edge computing but are susceptible to
physical attacks due to memristor nonvolatility. Recently, Rajendran et al.
(IEEE Embedded Systems Letter 2025) proposed a Physical Unclonable Function
(PUF)-based scheme to secure BNNs against theft attacks. Specifically, the
weight and bias matrices of the BNN layers were secured by swapping columns
based on device's PUF key bits.
  In this paper, we demonstrate that this scheme to secure BNNs is vulnerable
to PUF-key recovery attack. As a consequence of our attack, we recover the
secret weight and bias matrices of the BNN. Our approach is motivated by
differential cryptanalysis and reconstructs the PUF key bit-by-bit by observing
the change in model accuracy, and eventually recovering the BNN model
parameters. Evaluated on a BNN trained on the MNIST dataset, our attack could
recover 85% of the PUF key, and recover the BNN model up to 93% classification
accuracy compared to the original model's 96% accuracy. Our attack is very
efficient and it takes a couple of minutes to recovery the PUF key and the
model parameters.

Conclusion: 该框架为在零信任云环境中部署安全的机器学习即服务（MLaaS）系统提供了可行路径，能够在保证数据机密性的同时满足实际应用需求。

Abstract: As machine learning (ML) models become increasingly deployed through cloud
infrastructures, the confidentiality of user data during inference poses a
significant security challenge. Homomorphic Encryption (HE) has emerged as a
compelling cryptographic technique that enables computation on encrypted data,
allowing predictions to be generated without decrypting sensitive inputs.
However, the integration of HE within large scale cloud native pipelines
remains constrained by high computational overhead, orchestration complexity,
and model compatibility issues.
  This paper presents a systematic framework for the design and optimization of
cloud native homomorphic encryption workflows that support privacy-preserving
ML inference. The proposed architecture integrates containerized HE modules
with Kubernetes-based orchestration, enabling elastic scaling and parallel
encrypted computation across distributed environments. Furthermore,
optimization strategies including ciphertext packing, polynomial modulus
adjustment, and operator fusion are employed to minimize latency and resource
consumption while preserving cryptographic integrity. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed system achieves up to 3.2times inference
acceleration and 40% reduction in memory utilization compared to conventional
HE pipelines. These findings illustrate a practical pathway for deploying
secure ML-as-a-Service (MLaaS) systems that guarantee data confidentiality
under zero-trust cloud conditions.
